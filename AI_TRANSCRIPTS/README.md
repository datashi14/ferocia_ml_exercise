## Overview

This folder contains complete transcripts of AI-assisted sessions during the development
of the Ferocia ML exercise.

## Sessions

1. **01_initial_planning_gemini.md** - Model selection, pseudo-ID design, business KPIs
2. **02_architecture_refinement_gemini.md** - Ferocia-specific requirements alignment
3. **03_production_gaps_analysis_gemini.md** - Critical error analysis (duration leakage, etc.)

## AI Tools Used

- Google Gemini: Strategic planning and gap analysis
- GitHub Copilot: Code completion (minimal use)

## Human Contributions

- All core ML logic (deterministic splitting, PSI calculation)
- Production experience from Wesfarmers/Tabcorp informed design decisions
- Critical evaluation of all AI suggestions against 3-hour time constraint
